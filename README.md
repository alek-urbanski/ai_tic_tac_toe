# ai_tic_tac_toe
This repository contains code for an evolutionary training process applied to an AI Tic Tac Toe player. It includes the following main files: trainer.py (abstract environment for evolutionary training), ai.py (AI tic tac toe player code), engine.py (game logic and player protocol), and train_ai.py (main script for running the training).

This project was created for educational purposes and feedback is welcome. Keep in mind that while the probability of finding the optimal player increases with the size of the evolving population, the resources required also increase. I did not have enough time or computing power (or maybe luck) to finish the training successfully, but it was still enjoyable to write.
